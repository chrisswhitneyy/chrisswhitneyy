### 🧭 Engineering Principles

- **Build for reality**: software must survive real users, bad data, and weird edge cases.
- **Simplicity > novelty**: boring tech that works beats clever tech that breaks.
- **Data-informed decisions**: measure everything that matters.
- **Automation first**: if it’s repetitive, it should be scripted.
- **Ownership mindset**: code is a product, not just an implementation.
